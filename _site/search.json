This is checked by DBItest, which also provides a human-readable specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBI\n\n\n\n\n\nR Database Interface\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nBackends\nThe RSQLite, MariaDB, and RPostgres packages implement methods defined by DBI that connect to specific databases. There are more packages that connect to other databases.\n\n\nBoilerplate\nThe RKazam package makes it easy for package developers to create a new package to a new DBMS."
