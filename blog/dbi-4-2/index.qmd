This is a continuation of the [first blog post](https://r-dbi.org/blog/posts/dbi-4-1/) in this series.

## Measuring responsiveness

For 2022 and 2023, no concrete new features were planned.
Instead, the focus has been on establishing a steady pace of maintenance and responsiveness to user feedback.
This blog post shows how we have been doing in this regard.

```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

library(here)
```

This analysis is based on the GitHub issues opened in the r-dbi organization since development has moved to GitHub, for the following packages: DBI, DBItest, RMariaDB, RPostgres, RSQLite, dblog, RKazam.

In total, `r readLines(here("all-issues.txt"))` issues and pull requests were opened in the package repositories, of which `r readLines(here("new-issues.txt"))` were opened in 2022 or later.

![Issues opened per year](issues_per_year.png)

The bar chart shows the number of issues opened per year.
In recent years, the vast majority of the issues were opened by contributors and non-members.

To analyze responsiveness, we consider the time it takes from opening an issue by a non-member to the first response by a member, and to closing the issue.

![Time to first member comment](time_to_first_response.png)

Responsiveness to issues has improved, the majority of issues are now responded to within a single day.
Unfortunately, some issues still required more than two weeks until the first response.
The situation is similar for pull requests: Some are reviewed within a few days, but others remain unreviewed for more than two weeks.

![Time to close issues](time_to_close.png)

The time to close issues varies too.
Many can be closed within a day or a week, but some issues remain open for months or even years.
For PRs, it depends whether they were created by CI/CD or by a human.
Autogenerated PRs tend to get merged or closed much faster, but the general pattern is similar to issues.
