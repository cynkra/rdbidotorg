:::{#about-rdbi}
R's interface to databases, with a testable and human-readable specification, a selection of backend packages to connect with various databases, and a boilerplate for developing new backends.

## Packages

### Interface

The [DBI](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/) package defines generic methods that work almost identically across databases. 
This is checked by [DBItest](https://dbitest.r-dbi.org/), which also provides a human-readable [specification](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html).

### Backends

The [RSQLite](https://rsqlite.r-dbi.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.r-dbi.org/), and [RPostgres](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org/) packages implement methods defined by DBI that connect to specific databases. 
There are more packages that connect to other databases.

### Boilerplate

The [RKazam](https://rkazam.r-dbi.org/) package makes it easy for package developers to create a new package to a new DBMS.
